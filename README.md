# Password Generator Starter Code

This random password generator is to allow the user to create a password.  When the user clicks the generate button, prompts will appear to ask the user how long the password will be (between 8 and 128 characters).  It will also, ask if they want uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special symbols to be inculded.  The user must use at least one of these in order for the generator to work properly.
